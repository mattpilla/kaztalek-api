# Kaztalek's Personal Website
I can't think of an h1 that doesn't sound lame.\
I'll write this readme in the future.

## Scripts
- `npm start`: Starts the app, what can I say
- `npm run ui`: Clones the UI repo and builds it into the `ui/` directory

## Stuff to Know
- The UI is disposable. It currently lives [here](https://github.com/mattpilla/kaztalek-ui)
- All environment variables can be set in a `.env` file in the root directory
